# Mesky QOL
QoL (*Quality of Life*) for Hypixel Skyblock

**• Version: forge 1.8.9**
(*Not downloadable for now, because its current state is trash.*)

⪢ Features: 
- [x] Stops flower weapons from placing on blocks (*Flower of Truth & Spirit Sceptre*)
- [x] Fishing timer
- [ ] Waypoints (not saveable so useless) + can't delete them lol
- [ ] Chat alerts (also not saveable) + the same thing here

Thats probably all for this version, because i started 2 days ago and its my first time with Java + im banned from Hypixel for using "printer" in Schematica by accident (30 days...)

⪢ TODO:
  - [ ] Config file for saving options, etc.
  - [ ] Bonzo/Spirit mask timer
  - [ ] Settings/Alerts/Waypoints and changing locations
  - [ ] Utils for Kuudra (standing spots, pearl spots, etc) *but i have to learn them first*
  - [ ] I will try solvers, because them seem to be fun
  - [ ] Lowest bin (don't know anything about api)
  - [ ] Checking profiles (the same thing)
  - [ ] Maybe spam hidder (but idk what type of messages should be in filter)

<!-- Unity + C# was easier than this, there's almost no documentation about forge 1.8.9 --!>
